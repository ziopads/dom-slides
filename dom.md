# The DOM is ...


1. The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface (API) for HTML (and XML) documents. 
1. a fully object-oriented representation of the web page.
1. can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

# The Document

1. A document can be textually represented via HTML (how the developer sees a web page).
1. A document can be visually represented via the browser window (how the user sees a web page).
1. A document can be digitally represented via the DOM (how the program sees a webpage).

# DOM Traversal

---

# Objectives for Traversing the DOM

1. Query the the DOM for nodes using CSS selectors.
2. Traverse the DOM using parent, sibling and children nodes.
3. Access the values of HTML attributes and the innerText of a node.

---

# Querying the DOM

1. Methods
2. Outputs
	- Elements vs Nodes
	- HTML Collections vs NodeLists
		- HTMLCollections
			- Contains Elements
		- NodeLists
			- Contains ChildNodes

---



# Object Methods for Querying the DOM

getElementbyID
getElementsByClassName
getElementsByName
getElementsByTagName
getElementsByTagNameNS
querySelector
querySelectorAll

---


# Activity

Two whiteboards

1. Divide into groups of four
	- Consult the documents for your DOM method
	- Consider your inputs and outputs
2. On two whiteboards
	- clarify inputs and outputs
	- On another white board, write example code

---

# Activity

Group 1: getElementbyID
Group 2: getElementsByClassName
Group 3: getElementsByName
Group 4: getElementsByTagName
Group 5: getElementsByTagNameNS
Group 6: querySelector
Group 7: querySelectorAll

# DOM Manipulation

---

# Objectives for Traversing the DOM

1. Access properties of DOM elements such as text, html, value.
2. Set an elementâ€™s text.
3. Add, update, and remove attributes on elements.
4. Add, update, and remove styles on elements.
